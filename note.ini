Recover Time Objective (RTO) is the maximum time the platform or service can be unavailable.

Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the maximum amount of time that the system can lose data for. RPO is not tied to whether the system is available, it is a measure of the window of time that data may be lost in.

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage

See the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html) for details on high availability (Multi-AZ). In the event of a planned or unplanned outage of your DB instance, Amazon RDS automatically switches to a standby replica in another Availability Zone if you have enabled Multi-AZ. The time it takes for the failover to complete depends on the database activity and other conditions at the time the primary DB instance became unavailable. Failover times are typically 60â€“120 seconds. However, large transactions or a lengthy recovery process can increase failover time. When the failover is complete, it can take additional time for the RDS console to reflect the new Availability Zone.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage

If there is a single region outage, the read replicate in the secondary region needs to be manually promoted in the AWS console. The replication between the master and read replica is asynchronous. The promotion of the read replica takes a few minuts to complete and the endpoint of the read replica is different from the master, so the replica promotion requires also a change in all the applications that use the database. We can assume an RTO of about 10 minutes.

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage

If we assume that the replication is in sync at the time of the outage, the RPO is zero. As failover times from the primary to the standby instance are typically 60-120 seconds, it is however possible that data can be lost during the switch.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage

If we again assume that the replication is in sync at the time of the outage, the RPO is zero. As we have to manually promote the replica and change the database endpoint configuration in all the applications that use the database, it is however possible that data can be lost during the switch (about 10 minutes).
